This is my Record Label DDD implementation for the Sofka U Challenge.

I have modeled my studio services subdomain using two aggregates, each of them with three entities and a total of 12 value objects.

I created the 12 usecases and 12 tests, 10 using commands and 2 triggered by events. All of the tests have 100% of coverage.
